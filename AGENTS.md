# Agent Guidance

This project is a configuration for [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs).

The user of this configuration uses emacs to edit primarily [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) projects, usually with [phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) and [liveview](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html). The user needs syntax highligting and LSP to work well when editing a project with phoenix and liveview.

The user prefers stability, dependability, and maintainability over flashy features.
